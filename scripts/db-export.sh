#!/bin/sh
#
# This script performs data processing on a given dataset.
# It reads data from an input file, processes the data to filter out
# unwanted entries, and then writes the cleaned data to an output file.
#
# Usage:
#   ./data_processing.sh input_file output_file
#
# Arguments:
#   input_file  - The path to the input data file.
#   output_file - The path to the output data file where cleaned data will be saved.
#
# Example:
#   ./data_processing.sh raw_data.csv cleaned_data.csv
#
# The script assumes that the input file is in CSV format and contains
# a header row. The processing steps include:
#   - Removing rows with missing values
#   - Filtering out rows based on specific criteria
#   - Normalizing data values
#
# Dependencies:
#   - awk
#   - sed
#   - grep
#
# Ensure that these tools are installed and available in your PATH.
